Introduction to AI and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transforming industries worldwide. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or tech enthusiast, understanding the core concepts of AI and ML is crucial in today's digital landscape. This blog post will introduce you to key ideas discussed in a recent AI training session, covering everything from neural networks to model training.

What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

AI refers to computer systems that mimic human intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and decision-making. It encompasses a broad range of technologies, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP).
